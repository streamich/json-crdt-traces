An epic synopsis of friends for the win... This is the saddest episode / show I've seen in a long time. Holy hell 90s american sitcoms were a total vibe.

There's basically 3 plot lines going at once in this episode:

- The one where someone works somewhere awful and gets bullied for it.
- The one where some 40 year olds pretend to be 16 year old boys
- And the one where the brown haired lady is going to start a catering company with her friend, then she writes a scathing review of a resteraunt instead. Then she gets offered a job there and eventually accepts, only to discover her new job will be shithouse and everyone hates her. They might break her kneecaps about it. By next episode, they will never
mention the Alessandro's incident again. But I digress..

So, we open to an exterior and there is a green van. They cross the street. There is a lot of 90s banter. There is an airbrushed picture of a lady on it. Chandler cracks a few funnies. He's the funny one. It turns out this is a van two of the girls have bought. Phoebe makes a joke about changing it, and we think that she means the secy lady on it but she means the sword getting turned into a baguette. Ha ha. (chandler?) has a clowning moment when her boobs have little lights come on. "I definitely know her!" har har. Because he's a man sluut. This would not happen in 2023 because people would get mad.

I'm not sure whats going on lower in this document, but I'm here to tell you about the plotline involving Gandalf.

The beats are like this:

1. Oh wow I'm so excited, my life is so sad and I'm such a nerd but Gandalf is like the best at partying and he's going to come party with us. Yaaay
2. Yay lets go party
3. Yay we're so happy, come with us aging 40 year old man! Aren't we cool bros?
4. Oh nooo, could you believe it? He's not coming after all. I guess we'll need to party on our own. Wah wah. So sad. 
4.5. I'm just going to sit on this old couch and be sad until Joey comes over. There is a white greyhound scultpture in the background. I remember that this was a storyline in another one because someone or many someones thought it was ugly. 
5. We're inexplicably hanging out in the same cafe we go to in every single episode. (After a pub crawl? In the day?) Dialogue: Oh, I'm so old now. I'm 29. Can you believe it? I'm old! We're all old! I just want to have a bath and make fun of my nerd friend. Its so relatable. Why are pubs so loud? Raw raaaawwww. I think they mentioned being 29 about 8 times. WE'RE 29 YEARS OLD EVERYONE. NOT 40. WHY WOULD YOU THINK THAT AHAHAH


Then there's the plotline about being bullied at work. Its so funny! Its with the non-hippy blonde. You know, the one with the good hair.

Scene 1:
- "Oh, I want this job! I want to not be your assistant! wowwww"
- "Hahaha I literally slept with an ugly man to get my current job. Joking, no I'm not joking! hahaha sexual harrassment is funny. I'll give you the job you want if you have sex with me. Hahahhaha jokinnnggg!" Ps I'm on the hiring committee.

Scene 2:
We're in an awkward small office. 3 people are assessing blond girl for the job.

Middle nerd: "I'm impressed with this thing on your resume!"
Blonde's boss: "hahaha she sucks tho, and she wants to have sex with me. Hahaha bullying is fun".
Nerd: <Constipated face>. Wow he's really buying it
Blonde: Wow, why are they so mean? I'm confused, pikachu!
Man in middle (makes 90s judging face at other interviewer, because the 90s loved to underline their humour as there was a musical break): Wow, it sounds like the blonde girl is a real mess!! #gaslit

Scene 3:
Back in the office.
Blonde: [Starts crying a bit, but weirdly]
This is really odd. It kind of seems like it wasn't necessary, or they didn't run with it. No one was comfortable with their emotions in the 90s, huh? The whole scene is basically derailed by talking about how uncomfortable everyone is about emotions in the workplace. I'm not really sure who's side we're supposed to be on here - there's no counter voice with any amount of maturity or sanity in this scene.

Blonde: Why are you so mean? That was awful! I'm quitting!
Boss: Hahaha you weren't even there when I told them you're an alcoholic! hahaha. You binge drink!
Blonde: I quit
Boss: Don't quit, I was only mean to you because you're an ok assistant, not like that biatch Emily who I get perverse satisfaction from bullying. (But the audience is into it, so who's the real monster?). I'll give you a better job myself. Right now (BTW, could people just do that back in the day for real? Give someone a raise and an office, effective immediately??)
Blonde: I'm taking this muffin and leaving. The muffin is funny. See, it got a laugh from our canned laughter.

Scene 3:
Some random lady is taking out a box of stuff. We know that something is wrong because there is no way that Rachel/Jennifer Aniston's life is going to work out that well for her that quickly. Nope. We can definitely stretch out this storyline for another 5 seasons. It turns out that the boss is dead, she got hit by a cab. hahaha no one cares! How funneh! she didn't give her the job. Lol aren't the 90s great. The studio audience laughs along ha ha your boss is dead, it looks like no one is going to give you a raise, and an office... with walls. All of the great humour from this scene comes from the twin urges that rachel has to navigate of wanting to look like she cares for her baby-eating boss, but still trying to get the job as an assistant buyer that she was promised without looking like the bottom feeding scavenger we find out she is.

So she keeps trying to ask the grieving lady who told her that her boss died about if she sent paperwork about the job. No. She did not.

Emily - the butt of the joke earlier who the boss kept abusing - is visibly delighted at the death. I think she's there to give balance to the scene, but she honestly comes across as the most relatable in the moment.

The moral of this story is that bullying and lying about your employees was acceptable in the 90s. Nay, not only acceptable but a great way to unwind and laugh along with people who feel like they're your friends and constant companions. 


- There is this interview because Jennifer Aniston really wants to be an assistant buyer at Bloomingdales or one of those New York places that New Yorkers always talk about. Isn't new york just full of great things? She is wearing a grey suit that was probably really, really cool at the time. I think she was the one that everyone wanted to be. Wow, so cool. So in control. She's so cool she puts up with being abused in her workplace. Wowww.

The problem I have with this scene is how ok she is to be everyone's bitch. When its revealed that her boss is basically a major sociopath, she kind of takes it in stride - threatening to leave and then not leaving. I'm not really sure what to think about it - its not funny. It just feels kind of sad. I can't tell if she's deeply traumatised from a life of bullying, and thus she just thinks that sort of thing is normal. Or if she's genuinely so pathetic that she would still like to have this job even if it means working under someone who was born without a soul. Its not funny. Its not relatable. As an audience member, I have no empathy for the character. I'm no anti-work person, but ... yeah. Did people laugh along with this because they wanted to have the experience of laughing? Everyone in this entire plotline is awful, except the lady who spends every scene getting abused.

- Blonde talks to her boss. There is some ceramic of a lady in a red bikini in the background. There is an assistant Emily who is always getting wrecked. In 2023 this would be considered workplace bullying, but in the 90s Emily and the entire audience is totally here for it. To be honest, the quiet bullying of Emily is probably the thing that is the funniest in this entire episode now that making fun of people is utterly illegal according to the twelvies. It probably feels more fresh now than it did at the time.

- Monica wrote a critique of Alessandro's and said it's really bad. The guy from Alessandro's comes to the door and talks to Monica through the intercom. There is a gold frame around the peephole thing in the purple door, which you just know that 60,000 people around the world also did because it seemed quirky/cool. How many of those survived until 2023 I wonder? She tells him to just call her. He says no, you would just hang up on me. He also needs to yell at another critic. Phoebe is on the way out for reasons that are lost to time and is a bad friend and lets him in blithely because she is the airhead one. This could be the start of an episode of Forensic Files, but instead Monica is scared of his anger for about 15 seconds and then she instantly gets angry and tells him how crappy his restaurant is. She happens to have some tomatoes on the table, grabs them and says LOOK I'll show you how to make this sauce. While this is not that implausible for a person who likes to cook, it feels weirdly artificial. While she does it, he disses her and says "will this take long? I have another person to yell at". Which is in character, but it makes her offer to show him what it should taste like seem like awkward, unjustified fawning. He offers her a job as head chef, just based on her dissing his restaurant and the fact that she said his marinara sauce is watery and tastes like tomato juice - it just needs some vodka and a celery stick. This comes across as a really big diss. This is an especially 90s kind of sassy joke like "ooooh, you sauce so flavourless you could.... add these two ingredients.... and make it this kind of cocktail?" Most of the diss is in the tone. Is it just me or does it seem like there is some sexual tension in the air? She just says that he's not Italian and he says he's Lebanese. I guess the unspoken assumption is that Lebanese people don't konw how to run good resteraunts. This would raise a few eyebrows in 2023. She also said that a waiter carried the baguettes in his pants. If comedy is based on the subversion of expectations, then this certainly does give you a visual that fulfils this but... yeah, humour has come a long way. On the upside, it seems like episodes wouldn't take very long to write. I think ChatGPT could get a pretty good handle on this. ChatGPT could probably write a better episode of friends than this. I just tried with GPT4 and ... yeah, it wrote a better episode than this one. It involved the "hilarity" of a dinosaur costume and a fortune cookie gone wrong, which is totally on point with how awkward this whole show is.

-The boys are sad at home. It sounds like there isn't going to be any wild party. They are really driving this home that GANDALF Gandalf is this bigtime dude who is sooooooo fun and wild and they have had all these wild times together. Did I mention the BOAT? I kept waiting for them to make a "What happens in Vancouver stays in Vancouver" joke at Canada's expense. The episode really needed this in order to drive home the wildness of this storyline. They have massive "bro" vibes, but it comes off as really strange because they all look like they're in their 40s, so it's more like a story of two toolies and another guys who is just... around. Its like inverse Peter Pan with a side serving of cringe. They all talk about how loud it was in the place they were just at. I wonder what the actors were thinking at the time - did they ever have a silent protest and say their lines extra badly if they weren't happy with them? I feel like there's 2 running gags in this show: Making fun of the nerdy one of the group, and being bros. And I'm not sure which of those I more want to abandon to homeless people in central park. We didn't know it at the time but we were watching the fall of the bro empire - the last dying days where bros and bro vibes were at the top of the food chain.

- Now it's time for the girls to all have a chat in this giant New York apartment they have. A lot has been written about how they wouldn't have been able to afford this, but people like watching TV shows of people pretending to be 15 years younger than they are in places they could never afford and don't explain, so this one is on the audience. Monica's kitchen is weirdly stocked. Its utterly covered in fresh food and things - I guess she's supposed to be a chef. But ... its not clear. Doesn't she live alone? Maybe this is realistic. Foodies, am I rite? A lot of the humour in this scene comes from Rachel being super excited about her new job, but not wanting to show it because it's gotten awkward between the other two. I know a lot of people used to watch this all the time, deliberately. Did they see themselves or their ideal selves in these characters? When I was blonde, more than one person said I looked like Phoebe. I think it was just because I was tall and the show was popular.

- The boys are now sad at a coffee shop. One of them makes it weird by talking about listening to Kenny G in the bath. He has taken it TOO FAR. He is always the one who takes it TOO FAR. If you are a writer on a deadline then just write a line for Ross where he takes it TOO FAR. Over 14 seasons or whatever, this leads to him being quite the psychopath. I saw a video where they remove the laugh track from everything David Schwimmer says and it's truly chilling. I wonder what impact this character has had on his life. I saw him in Band of Brothers once and it was a serious war series and everything, but it was just like "hey look it's Ross! He's from Friends! Your job's a joke, you're broke, your love life's DOA" every time he was on screen. I wonder what dreams he had when he started on the show and where he thought his career was going to lead him. When he thinks back to these moments, or when he watches the show, does he know where it all went wrong? Does he stare into a bottle of alcohol with the complete awareness that everything he's done is his fault, and the descent into madness happened one awkward conversation about BEING TWENTY NINE EVERYONE at a time? I hope so. I hope he knows what he was doing. I hope he did it on purpose, scene by scene, show by show, all 10 seasons of friends thinking "I hate myself, and this is how I will truly crush my soul before the bottle takes me."

Maybe this is really an existentialist piece about how nothing matters. People say Seinfeld is like that, but I think there's more masked soullessness in this episode of friends than in seinfeld. I think the characters of seinfeld are more in touch with the deep meaningness of their lives, while in friends its like they're all trying, hoping against hope to keep the last remaining flickers of the flame of youth. And ironically, grasping so hard at it only smothers it even more. This is the true moral of this episode. Blonde girl tries to get her dream of not being someone's bitch, and she does it by staying loyal to an abusive boss. The boys try to remember being young and partying, but they aren't young and by the end they just seem kind of crushed. And brown hair lady attempts 3 different careers, and all she gets at the end, after abandoning her friend, is an expectation that she's going to end up in a ditch somewhere. The moral of all of these stories is that you're old, your dreams are stupid and you're probably never going to achieve any modicum of the hope you held as a child. If you try to chase after it, it gets even worse and you'll hurt your friends in the process. Hahaha aren't the 90s funny and relatable everyone? On the upside, apparently lots of people successfully used Friends to learn English because it's really easy to follow the storyline with all the underlining, even without understanding the language. Maybe it was an improvement.

Maybe this is really a show about the writers / creators. They're grown adults, making a show about adult-babies who can't grow up. People who pretend on the outside they're cool and fun, while slowly, agonisingly slowly realising that all the dreams they had in youth are gone and all they're doing is fighting, hoping against hope that someone will save them and deliver them into the success they've always dreamed about. And their characters will never find that success, because deep down the writers don't believe its possible. But how funny is that one guy in the laugh track, amirite? Hahaha chandler!! What a larrakin. For sure, every single writer for the show identifies as Chandler, the one who is sassy and cynical and better than the others. It's almost like they want to include a version of themselves in the show so they can live out their dream of being cutting and always having the cool comeback, but only because they worked on it for weeks. It's wish-fulfilment for NY writers - now if someone is rude to you on the street, you can write them into a storyline and give Chandler a zinger to get them back. ZING! Take that! Feel my wrath! You'll be sorry you crossed me! I SAID, FEEL MY WRATH.

-Phoebe and Monica are the the Central Perk. For some reason there is an enormous cup of coffee with Cappuccino written on it. I wonder if there really was coffee in that cup.... I bet there wasn't.... Phoebe is wearing a shirt that looks like brown furry amoebaes. It is the most 90s shirt ever in the history of humanity. It belongs in a museum. Monica is also wearing an awfully large amount of brown too. She is wearing a brown leather jacket. The whole scene has a bit of a case of The Browns. Or at least the characters do. Honestly the coffee shop seems more interesting than the characters.
Monica has written lots and lots of ideas of what Phoebe could do with the van. It is clear that Monica is neurotic and Type A (this was a HUGE source of storylines in the 90s - "being type A". Also "using air quotes." You just don't hear of that anymore. It makes you nostalgic, really.... We are encouraged to laugh along with Monica being so full on, and there is meant to be this emotional beat where Monica is being FUNNY! FUNNY! FUNNY! (i.e. you could deliver bread to people) and then she makes this really serious 90s face to underline that this is an emotional beat and says no, I'm not going to take the job. This seems kind of stupid and self-abnegating because for sure she is going to resent Phoebe for the decision she just made. Then it's Phoebe's turn to underline the emotional beat. She says Monica should take the job, but then she makes it about herself. We, the audience are encouraged to laugh along with this - after all, don't we all know some airhead just like that?? Nawwwwww *group hug* look at these FRIENDS being FRIENDS. I feel all warm inside and like I belong to something bigger than myself. Funny how often one types "myslef" when that's not even a word. Now, what's for dinner - pasta? Or..... spaghetti MARINARA hehehehehe.

- Wouldn't you know it, it turns out Emily got the boss's old job. 

-The credits roll. Someone called Marta Kaufman and Dauvid Kaufman are responsible for what you just saw, and a whole generation of kids thinking this is normal.

- Then we cut to being in a restaurant. It's funny because they have fired the dad of lots of the workers who are at the restaurant. Monica has some puns. We leave on a vaguely threatening expectation that the Lebanese people in the restaurant are going to make her life a living hell. Its low key racist. Hahaha lebanese people tho? *uncomfortable*




I'm not sure where to put this, but the comedy in this show has a certain Vibe I find it tricky to describe. Everything is very *on*. There's no space between the jokes, or space as an audience to take a breath and relax. Its like a 3 course meal with no time in between to digest anything. Or like a concert where they speed up all the songs and don't give anyone a chance to breathe between them. I can imagine that sort of thing being an enjoyable mellow vibe where you trance out, but instead it feels like panicked escapism. Its funny - its easy to have nostalgia for the 90s but watching this feels like the worst parts of social media, crammed into a tv show, with cringe jokes and no opportunity during the show to put it down and take a breather. It is a brief, 22 minute escape from the awareness that you're slowly dying. Crammed so full of tacky laughs that you stay safe from those pesky thoughts about your own mortality. Run, mouse, run. Maybe if you do the escapism dance hard enough the reaper won't find you.

Maybe part of the problem is that the jokes aren't good. Have our standards gone up? Or has culture just moved on? Weirdly watching this I wonder if maybe the bar has raised for comedy online thanks to meme culture.

So I guess I've learned something today. I've learned that the 90s were also awful, and maybe I shouldn't be so hard on social media for ruining a generation. At least the kids today have better taste than to watch swill like this. Most "influencers" are at least kind of relatable. This show is truly stuck in second gear.

You know what real comedy would look like? These characters, at a silent retreat for a week, with shock collars around their necks so whenever they make noises they get zapped. They're allowed back in society when they've acknowledged the deep hole in their collective hearts. Chandler never does, and he runs off and dies.
